This post explores the Healthy Ride dataset using network analysis. 

This is my second post about the Healthy Ride bike service in Pittsburgh. You can find the first post [here](https://ctompkins.netlify.com/2017/10/18/exploring-healthy-ride-pittsburgh-data/), where I did some exploratory analysis of the data.

Load the R packages we will be using:
```{r load_packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggraph)
library(igraph)
library(lubridate)
library(viridis)
library(stringr)
```
